Javascript: Definitive Guide Notes
Chapter 2: Lexical Scope

Remember that the semicolon is used to separate statements

You can usually omit the semicolon if those statements are written on separate lines:
```JS
a = 3;
b = 4;
```

The semicolons would be required in this case:
```JS
a = 3; b = 4;
```

Note though that JS treats breaks as semicolons only if it can't parse the code without semicolons.

It treats a line break as a semicolon if the next non-space character cannot be interpreted as a continuation of the current statement:
```JS
var a 
a = 
3
console.log(a);
```

The above code would be interpreted as follows:
```JS
var a; a = 3; console.log(a);
```

There are two exceptions to this rule:
  1 - The words return, break, and continue often stand alone.
    If a line break appears after any of these words, JS will always interpret that line break as a semicolon:
    return 
    true;
  JS assumes you meant:
  return; true; 
  This is what leads to an error if you place return on a separate line.

  2 - operators like ++ and -- can be prefix or postfix operators that must appear on the same line:
  x 
  ++
  y
  This would be intepreted as x; ++y; not as x++; y;
