//On IF statements

let cond = 1;

if (cond) {
  console.log("Executed!")
} else {

}

//This would return "Executed" b/c as you know, 1 is seen as a truthy primitive value
//What if it were 2 though? This would return true as well, and 0 would be false

//But consider the following:
console.log(2 == true); //returns false
//What gives?
/*Well, JS only treats 0 as false for conditionals, and anything that doesn't equal 0 
is true as far as numeric primitives are concerned.*/
//So... cond could equal -1, -2, or even -.000003033/232322, and return true

//What about this then:

let condition = "text";

if (condition) {
  console.log("Executed!")
} else {

}

//This still returns true. Again, its this truthy vs falsy. 
    //An empty string would indeed be false, b/c it is falsy, whereas a string containing chars is truthy

//The same as far as falsy would go for null, which would be "Not Executed!"

//JS is a dynamic typing language:
let var1 = 1;

console.log(var1); // 5

var1 = 10;

console.log(var1) // 10

//It never cares about the type either, unlike other languages:
let var1 = 1;

console.log(var1); //Variable is a number here: 5

var1 = "10";

console.log(var1) //Variable becomes a string here: "10"

//Look out for section 8.7.7 on callable objects vs true functions.

let arr = [1,2,3];

console.log(arr.slice(2)); //[2, 3]
console.log(arr); //[1, 2, 3]
console.log(arr.splice(2)); //[3]
console.log(arr); //[1, 2]

//Just remember that slice doesn't change the original array while splice does.

    //This is the first one on, first on off. Like a stack of books.
    //A more practical example is your browser's back button.
    /*So you are at Facebook.com, and you, then you go to github.com, 
    which is like saying stack.push(github.com). But, if we hit the back
    button, then it is like saying stack.pop(github.com)*/
  //The functions traditionally provided in this stack are:
  let arr = [];
  arr.push();

  arr.peek(); //returns the value at the start of an array

  //On fat arrow functions vs regular JS functions
  //While there are some similarities, some differences do exist:
  // (param1, param2, paramN) => expression
  // ES5
  var add = function(x, y) {
    return x + y;
  };
// ES6
  let add = (x, y) => { return x + y };
//The ES6 version is less code.
//It can be even shorter if only one expression exists:
  let add = (x, y) => x + y;
//arguments do not have arguments binding
/*However, they have access to the argument object of 
  the closest non-arrow parent function ... what?*/
/*Well, named and rest parameters are heavily relied upon 
  to capture the arguments passed to arrow functions*/
//In the case of a regular function:
  let myFunc = {  
   showArgs(){ 
    console.log(...arguments); 
   } 
  }; 
  myFunc.showArgs(1, 2, 3, 4); //logs and object of {0:1,1:2,2:3,3:4}

     console.log(...arguments); 
   } 
  }; 
  myFunc.showArgs(1, 2, 3, 4); //ReferenceError: arguments is not defined
//Unlike regular functions, arrow functions do not have their own 'this'
  /*The value of this in an arrow function remains the same throughout the
    lifecycle of the function and always bound to the value of this in
    the closest non-arrow parent function.*/

       thisInArrow:() => { 
     console.log("My name is " + this.name); // no 'this' binding here 
   }, 
   thisInRegular(){ 
       console.log("My name is " + this.name); // 'this' binding works here 
     } 
    };
   me.thisInArrow(); //My name is
   me.thisInRegular(); //My name is Ashutosh Verma
  //This is actually a good thing b/c it resolves the this pointer uncertainty:

    console.log(this.message);
   }
  };
  printMessage();               // output: Hello World
  jsObject.printMessageES5();   // output: undefined
  /*So, when our code looked for a variable named message in jsObject, 
  it couldn't find it. Let's fix the code and add the message variable 
  in our object.*/

/*Regular functions created using function declarations or expressions are

  can never be invoked with the new keyword.*/
let add = (x, y) => console.log(x + y);
new add(2,3); //TypeError: add is not a constructor

//This keyword
//Good definition to remember:
  //this keyword refers to the current object that the code is being written inside of
//You know what this would reference here:
// console.log(this); //window object
//Or even this:
    let obj = {
      checkThis: function() {
        console.log(this); 
      }
    }
    obj.checkThis(); //would refer to obj; unless its an arrow function...
//So we might always assume that this always refers to the object in which it is declared
//But...
  let func = obj.checkThis;
func(); //returns window object, even as an arrow function
//this really is determined by the way in which a function is called
//So above, we call the function directly on obj (obj.checkThis)
//Therefore, obj was the reference to this
//With creating a new context with func, this gets assigned to the global object
//This is an issue:
    let objTwo = {
      checkThis: function() {
        console.log(this); //points to objTwo; arrow func would point to window obj
        function checkOther() {
          console.log(this); //points to window object; same as arrow
        }
        checkOther();
      }
    }
    objTwo.checkThis();
//The way to resolve this is not with an arrow function but as follows:
    let objThree = {
      checkThis: function() {
        let that = this;
        console.log(this); //points to objTwo; arrow func would point to window obj
        function checkOther() {
          console.log(that); //points to window object; same as arrow
        }
        checkOther();
      }
    }
    objThree.checkThis();

    //Another way to deal with this though could be using these methods:
  //call()
  //bind()
  //apply()
//As you know, functions are a type of object
//So there are lots of methods that come attached to a function object:
function asim() {
  console.log(this);
}
console.log(asim.name); //returns asim
//You can even add properties as an object:
asim.moo = 1;
//call() stabilizes the value of this. so:
asim.call(); //you can pass anything in as this
asim.call(1);
asim.call({}); //These all get assigned as this for the call in the func
//So back to the old example.
//Rather than a hacky move like let that... we can use call:
let obj = {
  checkThis: function() {
    console.log(this); //points to obj
    function checkOther() {
      console.log(this); //points to obj
    }
    checkOther.call(this);
  }
}
obj.checkThis();
//You can also pass parameters to call(). 
//Parameters will be anything after the first parameter, which determines 'this'
function a(b,c,d) {
  console.log(this); //1
  console.log(b); //2
  console.log(c); //3
  console.log(d); //4
};
a.call(1,2,3,4);

//apply() method is similar to call()
  //The one difference being that you pass any parameters as an array.
  //So with the example above, it would pass as follows:
//   a.apply(1, [2,3,4])
  //The reason to use apply() over call():
  function sum() {
    let total = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < arguments.length; i++) {
      total += arguments[1] //Did you know that arguments is a reserved word?
                            //It is an array that can be used, which all functions have
    }
    return total
  }
  let nums = [13,45,63,1,4,755];
  console.log(sum.call(null, nums)); //NaN
    //call() would still work if the listed numbers were passed directly in as arguments
  console.log(sum.apply(null, nums)); //270
    //apply() should be used when dealing with a variable that is an array
//bind() method is similar to the above, but with a little different syntax:
let b = function() {
console.log(this)
}.bind(1); //this will now return 1
console.log(b); //IMPORTANT NOTE - bind only works with function expressions:
function b() {
console.log(this)
}.bind(1); 
console.log(b); //Unexpected token error
//this happens b/c bind() is applicable to the object that created it

//Constructor pattern vs prototype pattern vs classical pattern
  //Just remember the following of each:

  //Constructor Pattern
  function Person(firstName, lastName) {
    this.firstName = firstName;
    this.lastName = lastName;

    this.fullName = function() {
      return `My name is ${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`
    }
  } 

  let steve = new Person("Steve", "Johnson");

  //Prototype Pattern (Prototypal Inheritance) - creates a blueprint obj that helps create any other objects
  function Person(firstName, lastName) {
    this.firstName = firstName;
    this.lastName = lastName;
  }

  Person.prototype.fullName = function() {
    return `My name is ${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`
  }

  let carl = Object.create(Person); 

  //Class Pattern (Classical Inheritance) - ES6 feature that is just sugar on top of prototypes
  class Person {
    constructor(firstName, lastName) {
      this.firstName = firstName;
      this.lastName = lastName;
    }
  }

  //Main take aways:
    /*Keeping in mind that functions are first-class citizens in Javascript, we can deal with them 
    just like objects, in this case we're only adding a property to an instance of a function object. 
    Thats only part of the story, you must also know that any method attached via this will get re-
    declared for every new instance we create, which could affect the memory usage of the application 
    negatively if we wish to create so many instances.*/

    /*Apart from low memory usage, the prototype approach is obviously faster in execution when creating 
    new object instances since no time is spent on re-declaring any methods. However, there will be a 
    slight decrease in the speed of invoking a method in comparison to the first approach. This is because 
    when calling getFull the Javascript runtime will check for the method on the instance of the Person it 
    won't be found there directly so it will then check the prototype of Person to find it.*/

      {
      let a = "hi";
      var b = "bye";
      }
      console.log(b); //"bye"
      console.log(a); //ReferenceError: a is not defined
      console.log(b); //Would not run

    /*What is “this” keyword in JavaScript this keyword refers to an object, that object which is executing 
    the current bit of javascript code.*/

    /*In other words, every javascript function while executing has a reference to its current execution 
    context, called this. Execution context means here is how the function is called.*/

    //Notice what this refers to here:
      function checkThis() {
        console.log(this); //window object
      }
      checkThis(); //Note the function is executed or called in the global scope, which leads to the window reference.
      
      let obj = {
        checkThis: function() {
          console.log(this); //refers to obj context
        }
      }
      
      obj.checkThis(); //"this" refers to obj b/c it is the context of the method checkThis
    
    //but what about this:
      let func = obj.checkThis;
      func(); //Now it once again points to the global object, but why?
      //B/c again look at context of execution
      //func() technically looks like this window.func().
      //So its not called as a method of the obj context, but as an assumed function within the window object
    
    //Whereas with the other call (obj.checkThis()), obj becomes the context to the left of the dot notation
      let objTwo = {
        checkThis: function() {
          console.log(this); //refers to objTwo context
          function checkThat() {
            console.log(this); //refers to window object context
          }
          checkThat();
        }
      }
    /*The reason for this is as follows: this is not part of the closure scope, it can be thought of 
    as an additional parameter to the function that is bound at the call site. If the method is not 
    called as a method (lacking the dot notation) then the global object is passed as this.*/

    //Currying:
    /*Briefly, currying is a way of constructing functions that allows partial application of a 
    function’s arguments. What this means is that you can pass all of the arguments a function 
    is expecting and get the result, or pass a subset of those arguments and get a function back 
    that’s waiting for the rest of the arguments. It really is that simple.*/

    //So this:
    const greet = function(greeting, name) {
      console.log(`${greeting}, ${name}`);
    };
    greet("Hello", "Heidi"); //"Hello, Heidi"

    //Becomes this:
    const greetCurried = function(greeting) {
      return function(name) {
        console.log(`${greeting}, ${name}`);
      };
    };

    /*This tiny adjustment to the way we wrote the function lets us create a new function for any 
    type of greeting, and pass that new function the name of the person that we want to greet:*/

      let greetHello = greetCurried("Hello");
      greetHello("Heidi"); //"Hello, Heidi"
      greetHello("Eddie"); //"Hello, Eddie"

    /*We can also call the original curried function directly, just by passing each of the 
    parameters in a separate set of parentheses, one right after the other:*/

      greetCurried("Hi there")("Howard");

    /*With curried functions you get easier reuse of more abstract functions, since you get 
    to specialize. Let's say that you have an adding function*/

  //Callbacks; Promises; Asynchronous Callbacks; Async/Await:
    /*Aside: Because JavaScript is a synchronous language by design, and because the event loop 
    is implemented in the JavaScript engines that are part of browsers and application servers, 
    all of the asynchronous functionality in JavaScript is implemented in external libraries. 
    In fact, even commonly used asynchronous functions like setTimeout() are provided by 
    libraries and interfaces.*/

    //Main thing to keep in mind is that not all callbacks are asynchronous.
  //But all async functions have callbacks.

  //Well what is a callback?
  //def: A function that executes after another function has executed
  //Tall tale signs of a callback is where a function is passed as a param

  //Example:
  function doHomework(subject, callback) {
    console.log(`Starting my ${subject} homework.`);
    callback();
  }
  
  doHomework('math', function() {
    console.log('Finished my homework');
  });

  //Callbacks don't always have to be in the function call though:
  function doMoreHomework(subject, callback) {
    console.log(`Starting my ${subject} homework.`);
    callback();
  }

  function alertFinished(){
    console.log('Finished my homework');
  }

  doMoreHomework('math', alertFinished);

  //Remember what these are called though in reference:

  //Any function that receives another function as an argument is:
    //Higher Order Function
  
  //And any function passed in as that argument is:
    //Callback function

  function higherOrderFunction(x, callback) {
    return callback()
  }

  //Common example of callbacks:
    //.map
    //setTimeout
    //Click events
      /*This is b/c a callback says not to continue on the synchronous
      thread of JS until something gets resolved. So something like a 
      click events says, don't do this other thing until someone clicks a 
      certain button.*/

    //Note how there are two paths that make it an async callback:
      //success: if the api call is successful follow that path.
      //error: if there is an error, follow that path.

  //Callbacks though of course can have issues such as callback hell:
      const id = 'tylermcginnis'
